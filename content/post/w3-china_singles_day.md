# Notes
## Why
- Singles Day is the largest single-day sales even over the world, and its influence is becoming wider.
- Biggest sales
    - $45 billion purchased made in 24-hour period.
    - Three times of 2018's Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales combined.
    - More than 90% purchases happened on mobile devices, which were only accounted for 34% of that on Cyber Monday.
    - At least four other similar companies as Alibaba launched single-day promotions, but Alibaba captured 68 percent of total sales.

## What & How

**Single Day's growth is slowing and will need to further evolve**

- Past five years average of almost 50%, past two years 44%, this year 25% (more in line with retail growth in China).
- **Solution**: 
    - Tap new markets outside China
    - Leverage complementary events in more creative way. ðŸŒ°e.g. "See Now, Buy Now" fashion show in Shanghai's Mercedes-Benz Arena.
    - Set forecasting goals more realistic
    - Launch promotions on other holidays

**Discounts play a big role in Singles Day sales**

- Biggest discount drove additional market share. ðŸŒ°e.g. parent and baby products: 6 to 7 â†’ 18 to 19 percentage; skin-care and cosmetic brand: 3 to 5 â†’ 12 to 15 percent.
- Different discount form. ðŸŒ°e.g. direct online price cut, coupons which can be used both online or real stores, promotions offered during presale events, platform discounts offered by Tmall.
- Discount of Alibaba's subsidiaries. ðŸŒ°e.g. Ele.me, social media, music streaming and travel apps.
- Easily trap into unprofitable sales especially without deep cash reserves.
    - **Solutions 1**: Pair more modest discounts with free gifts. 
    - **Solutions 2**: Shift the emphasis towards to new products (ðŸŒ°e.g. Dyson used social media to launch its new Airwrap hair-curling product, Budweiser sold special package of beers, Johnson & Johnson introduced new flavored Listerine).

**Singles Day is spilling over to physical stores**

- Alibaba made sure offline stores offer discounts as well. ðŸŒ°e.g. 100 Hema supermarkets, 222 Easyhome furniture and home-improvement stores.
- Individual brands also used discounts and strategies such as click and collect to drive additional sale in store. ðŸŒ°e.g. Luckin Coffee -- "Buy 1, get 2 free", Xiaomi -- same discount for online and physical stores,
- Pros of ominichannel sales
    - Give customers the seamless integration of online and offline experience.
    - More meaningful services can be served in offline stores.

**Rooted in China, Singles Day is an increasingly global event**

- More than 19,000 multinational brands participated in Singles Day. Overall growth 24%, imported product growth 63% in Tmall. ðŸŒ°e.g. MartiDerm, Moony, Dyson, Schiff.
- Singles Day fanned out over the world. ðŸŒ°e.g. **Lazada** (almostly 91% owned by Alibaba) launched Singles Day in several Southeast Asia countries and its sale during the first hour sevenfold over last year. **Shopee** (leading online shopping platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan) grew its total customer orders by 4.5 times on Singles Day.
- AliExpress partnered with EL Corte InglÃ©s department store to create more than 2,000 click-and-collect pickup locations. And AliExpress's total sales on Singles Day grew 40 percent.
